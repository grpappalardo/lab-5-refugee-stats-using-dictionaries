This script creates a dictionary holding information about the populations of refugee camps in several countries (Bangladesh, India, Jordan, Botswana, and Liberia) in 2014. It iterates through the dictionary and outputs information through three functions. These functions print the country names, the populations of refugees, and statements about the number of refugees in each country. I did not have any major problems writing this script, and found it a useful way to practice working with dictionaries.
